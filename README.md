## About Me

I am an **Applied Scientist at Oracle**, working on AI for clinical health applications. Previously, I was a **Data Scientist at Kotak Bank**, where I built models to assess customer creditworthiness and identify risky customers early. I am interested in interdisciplinary studies where science intersects with code.
